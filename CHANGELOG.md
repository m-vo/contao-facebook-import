### v2.1.0
 - added automatic live long token generation via the backend

### v2.0.0
 - lots of small fixes and optimizations
 - code reorganization

 *Migrating from v1:*
 If you did not interact with the code programmatically, there is
 nothing that you need to do. Just adapt your composer requirement of
 the bundle to `^2.0`.
